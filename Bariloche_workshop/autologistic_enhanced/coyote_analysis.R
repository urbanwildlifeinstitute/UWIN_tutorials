# Step one: Read in and format the detection data

coyote <- read.csv(

)



# check out the structure of the data
dplyr::glimpse(coyote)



# convert the coyote data into a three dimensional array
#  using the function autoOcc::format_y(). The dimensions
#  of this array are site x primary sampling period x
#  secondary sampling period (within each primary).

  x = coyote,
  site_column = "Site",
  time_column = "Season",
  history_columns = "Week"
)


# Check out all the detection data for one site
coyote[15,,]


# and just as a safety measure, ensure that all sites
#  have at least SOME data. Since this is an
#  array the easiest way to do this is with the apply()
#  function. Since we just want to sum across all the
#  data for each site, the dimension (i.e., MARGIN)
#  we want to apply our function to is the first one.
nweeks_sampled <- apply(
  X = coyote,

  }

# Step two: read in and format the covariates

#  site-level covariates that do not vary through time

covs <- read.csv(
  "./data/coyote_covariates.csv"

dplyr::glimpse(covs)



# info on the stuff in this data.frame

# make an urbanization metric with tree cover (tree), impervious
#  cover (imperv), and housing density (housing_density)

urb_pca <- covs %>% 
  dplyr::select(tree, imperv, housing_density) %>% 
  prcomp(., center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)

# The first thing we want to see is how much variance each
#  component explains.
summary(urb_pca)


# The first one explains about 70% of the variation, so we will just
#  use that one. How we do interpret this? We look at the loadings:

round(
  urb_pca$rotation,
  2
)

# For PC1 we see that imperv and housing_density are both positive, while
#  tree is negative. This means that negative values of the urb_pca are
#  locations high in tree cover whereas positive values of the urb_pca
#  are locations high in impervious cover and housing density. So negative
#  is more forested and positive is more urban.

# The second covariate we have is the distance of each site to a stream
#  or river. We included this one as riparian areas are often
#  used a corridors for mammals. However, before we just include it
#  into our covariate data.frame for analysis we need to scale it.

occ_covs <- data.frame(
  urb = urb_pca$x[,1], # the PC1 term.
  dist_stream = as.numeric(
    scale(
      covs$dist_stream
    )
  )
)


# In addition to these covariate data, we also have weekly temperature
#  data to include as a detection covariate. Since Chicago experiences
#  four distinct seasons, coyote may alter their behavior when it's either
#  hot (the summer) or when its cold (the winter). This is also 
#  to show how to include survey-specific covariates on detection, which
#  is something autoOcc can handle.
week_temp <- read.csv(
  "./data/weekly_temp_data.csv"
)

# right now the data are set up so it varies by week, season, and then site. 
nweek <- dplyr::n_distinct(week_temp$Week)
nseason <- dplyr::n_distinct(week_temp$Season)
nsite <- dplyr::n_distinct(week_temp$Site)

# To set up this covariate we are going to need to create a matrix with a 
#  number of rows equal to nsite and a number of columns equal to nweek * nseason
#  the first nweek columns will be for the first season, then the next nweek
#  are for season 2, etc., etc. So each row is going to hold all the temperature
#  data for one site. Because of the way the ordering in week_temp (week,
#  season, then site) we can just input the covariate and fill the matrix
#  in the correct way by setting the byrow argument to TRUE.
temp_matrix <- matrix(
  week_temp$temp,
  ncol = nweek * nseason,
  nrow = nsite,
  byrow = TRUE
)

# Now, all columns of this matrix are associated to the same covariate, and so
#  to scale this covariate we need to divide each column by the global mean
#  and divide by the global standard devation (i.e., use the scale function).
#  since this is a matrix this is a bit easier to just do by hand.
temp_matrix <- (
  temp_matrix - mean(temp_matrix)
) / sd(temp_matrix)

# Now to the rest of the detection covariates. We are also going to include
#  urbanization here as coyote abundance likely covaries with this. As areas
#  with more coyote may increase how detectable they are, it makes sense
#  to try to control for this variation. Because we have this temp matrix,
#  the detection covariates MUST be in a named list.

# step 5: make some model predictions with the best-fit model

# to do this, we need to generate a new data.frame with all the
#  associated covariates tied to a given level of the model (i.e.,
#  occuapncy or detection). However, we scaled our covariates,
#  and to generate our predictions they need to be scaled
#  EXACTLY as the data we supplied to the model. In our
#  case, this is pretty easy. The urbanization covariate
#  is already kind of abstract, so we just need to generate
#  a sequence of values from around the same extent as the
#  data we supplied.
