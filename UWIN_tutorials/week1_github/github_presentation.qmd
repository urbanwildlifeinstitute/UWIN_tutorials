## Why is this a problem?

- How do you keep track of edits?
- How do we handle "accidents"?
- fundamentally, an issue with *data reproducibility*.

## Why worry about data reproducibility?

- We are currently experiencing a crisis of reproducibility in science!
- In response to this, code review is now a required component of peer review for many journals.
- Better, more reproducible code also makes it easier to standardize methodology.

## Git and GitHub

## What is Git? 

![](./images/git.png){width=20%}

- Started in 2005 - version control system for Linux developers
- Now, one of the most commonly used **distributed version control systems**

## What is GitHub?

![](./images/github-mark.png){width=30%}

- GitHub is **an easier, user-friendly way to use Git online**
- integrates with a number of other software platforms - including RStudio

# A brief overview of GitHub terminology

## Repository

- **Definition**: essentially, a project directory - where code, documents, and everything associated with a project will live.
- By default, typically contains a **README.md** file that describes the repository. 

## Clone

- **Definition**: the creation of a *local* copy of a *remote* repository.
  + In other words, you are copying the *remote* repository stored in the cloud on GitHub to a folder of your choice on your computer (i.e., creating a *local* copy).
  
## Branch

- **Definition**: Branches are used to isolate the development of code without affecting other parts of the code base.
  + When you create a repository you have one branch
  + New branches are created off an existing branch.
  + Branches are used to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained part of a repository.

## Branch (example)

Nathan has some code for a project that works, but he wants to improve the code to make it run faster. To do so Nathan creates a branch titled `performance-tests` off of the main branch so he can try out different ways to improve the speed of his code without affecting the code in the `main` branch.

## Commit
- **Definition**: a summary of changes made to files within a repository on a given branch.
- typically capture the following:
  + a commit log, explaining the commit and its contributor(s)
  + a unique hash ID (GitHub handles this for you).
  + the **parent** commit - basically, where your commit came from!
  + a summary of files that have changed
  + In essence, a commit is the changes you made to your *local* copy of a repository, which you want to save and eventually send up to the *remote* repository.
  + commit early, commit often!
  
## Push

- **Definition**: when *local* commits are pushed to a branch on a *remote* repository.
- What do we mean by this?
  + you will likely be creating a commit on a local machine.
  + after you create that commit, it will **not** be reflected in the remote repository until those changes are pushed.
  + Commits records changes to the *local* repository.
  + Pushes update the *remote* repository with commits you've made.

## Pull

- **Definition**: when *remote* changes on a branch are applied to your *local*, cloned repository.
- What do we mean by this?
  + if you are working on a repository collaboratively, others may make edits that are **not** initially reflected in your *local* repository. 
  + when you pull from the remote repository, these remote changes are synced with your local directory.
  + Not to be confused with pull requests, which are a different thing!

## Pull Request

- **Definition**: A pull request (PR) is a way to tell collaborators (or yourself)
that the changes you pushed to a branch are ready for review. Think of a pull request as a staging area that you use before you merge one branch back into another.
  + To set up a pull request, you have to select the branch with the code you changed and the branch you want to merge those changes into. 
  + When working collaboratively, someone else reviews the pull request, discussion happens, and based on that some followup commits may be needed.
  + Once approved, you can merge the feature branch into the other branch you selected.
  
## Pull Request (example)

Example: Mason want's to make a new function for his `autoOcc` R package. To do so, Mason created a new branch, pushed commits to that branch, and when the function was ready made a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.
  
  ![](./images/git_branch_merge.png){width=100% align=center}

## fork 

- **Definition**: A fork is a way to create a new repository based on a different repository you are (most often) not the owner of. 
  + You can think of forks it as a branch off a repository you do not own. You can make changes to your forked repository and then submit a pull request to the
  original project owner.
  + As such, forks are used a lot when working on open source projects.
  + Creating a fork is the easiest way to copy everything in someone else's repository.
  + However, if you are working on a research project with a few *trusted* people it is often easier to set them up as collaborators instead of having them fork your repository, make a PR of changes, etc.
  
  
# How to use GitHub in your projects (from most to least user friendly)

## Use GitHub Desktop!

::: {.incremental}
- Found at https://desktop.github.com.
- Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to do pretty much everything you would need to do.
- Can't handle complex Git commands, but 99.9% of researchers will not need them anyways.
- There are a few other things that are a bit easier to do from your internet browser instead of the desktop GUI.
  + Pull requests (i.e., merging branches)
  + Changing settings
  + Inviting collaborators to a repository
:::

## Link Rstudio with GitHub

::: {.incremental}
- Rstudio does provide a way to use GitHub within it's interactive developer environment (IDE)
- Can be a little finicky
- Not as general as GitHub desktop, so we suggest the GitHub Desktop GUI instead.
:::

## Git from the command line (GitHub CLI)

::: {.incremental}
- Bringing this up for completeness
- Used to be the primary way you could use Git via GitHub
- Do not suggest doing this when learning.
- Sometimes needs to be used to resolve certain issues, but those are quite rare (and the GitHub Desktop GUI provides you with the command line code to run if needed).

# Other things to know about GitHub

## Privacy settings

- Repositories can be public or private!
  + Public repositories are viewable by everyone
  + Private repositories are only viewable by yourself and collaborators you add to the repository
  + For most research projects, start your repository as private. You can change them to public when you submit the paper for publication.

## MERGE CONFLICTS!!!

- The most annoying part of version control.
- Happens when you try to merge branches and they have conflicting commits.
  + Example: Nathan and Mason are working on a project with GitHub. Nathan does the right thing and creates a new branch to modify a data analysis script. Mason makes some changes to that same script and pushes them to the main branch. When Nathan makes a pull request to merge branches, Git will need your help to decide which changes to incorporate into a final merge.
  
## Don't store everything on GitHub
::: {.incremental}
- Can't store files > 100 Mb on GitHub (so if you have big datasets you may need a workaround).
- Don't store files on the cloud that already live there (e.g., large spatial data files), but provide documentation on how to find those files!
- Don't store sensitive information in public repositories (e.g., API keys, passwords, etc.). GitHub has a way to use those safely.
:::

## It is really easy and free to archive your code and create a DOI
- GitHub interfaces with Zenodo, which is an open repository operated by CERN.
- After connecting the two, you can archive and generate a DOI for a given
repository in minutes.
- Archiving code and data is becoming increasingly common when papers get 
published, so you may as well start getting familiar with this process.
